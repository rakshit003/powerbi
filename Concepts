Data Acquisition
Import data-- data is loaded into Power BI app(makes report fast and need high performance)
Direct Query: Direct Query models store only meta data info and will query the data source based on the requiremtn(good for realtime data). 
Every visualization sends real time query to a database when a filter is selected in dashboard.No need to schedule dashboard.
Usefully if data volumne is very high and can't be loaded in a powerbi app.


-while data model is huge , user direct query
-real time scenario
- No data is loaded to memory of power BI
-Data source resources are flexible with adhoc traffic
-while connecting to database(you get an option of direct query)

Dual model: store data both in power bi app and direct query.
Live connection: 
Very Few db support live connection
Power BI dataset support it(only through live connection)
Power BI datasets are live, any changes will immideatly be seen in the dashboard

WriteBack capability

Data Flow: ETL(Is performed throw power query in cloud). Its a good way to seperate ETL layer with data and Reporting layer. This can be used without power bi application as well
helps in decoupling of data preperation layer from power bi reporting layer. What data flow does not support is modelling part of data which is done by dataset.

Dataset: Build relationship between tables, Hierarchies. DAX calculation and field formating and configuration is done by dataset.

Start vs Snowflake Schema:
in start , dimentions are only connected to fact tables. In snowflag, dimention table are also connected to other dimension tables(mainly sub dimnetions)

We can seperate different components on Power BI - DataFlow, Dataset and Reporting for reuse.
