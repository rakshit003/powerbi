-while data model is huge , user direct query
-real time scenario
- No data is loaded to memory of power BI
-Data source resources are flexible with adhoc traffic
-while connecting to database(you get an option of direct query)

Dual model: store data both in power bi app and in underlying dataset
Live connection: 
Very Few db support live connection
Power BI dataset support it(only through live connection)
Power BI datasets are live, any changes will immideatly be seen in the dashboard
